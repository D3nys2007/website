Welcome To The Source Code Of The Website "Bored Rn", here you can find the source code for a couple games from the games libary but the bigger games are located in seperate repositories so if you want to have a look at them you can

Disclamer:
The website theme aka the backround was not made by me but taken from the author "Credits at top of index.html page" for me to use as a template for my website
also none of the games or links to other websites were made by me but added by downloading the game's source code and adding it to the website

I have chosen to make this website's code public because github pages wont allow me to use https for some reason and i wanted to show that my website has 0 malware or trackers or cookies
in the code and all of the games have been tested by me and are downloaded on my pc, so I know they are not viruses
